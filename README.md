# WebViewPerformanceCompairison
Since UIWebView has been removed by Apple now and all the developers need to shift their WebView Components to WKWebView(if not already) and are still wondering why Apple removed the UIWebView component, well that's the very reason why i have created this performance comparison project

Before proceeding , please take note of a few points:

- I have not taken into consideration any memory leaks that are occuring in the project as it was not the scope of the project

- Since there are memory leaks, you have to rerun the project once you launched any of the WebView component

- I have simply opened a Google homepage in both of the WebView components

- I ran the app on the iOS Simulator
